            <h2>About SmartStride</h2>
            <p>Smart Stride is a group of five seniors working on their final capstone project. This design and engineering challenge with a health focus was chosen to address a challenge in the medical community. Currently, in the world of telehealth, the expansions of sensors in at-home technologies continue to grow. This device sits right alongside your at-home blood pressure or heart monitor, allowing for patients to categorize and collect data about their individual condition individually. With SmartStride, we’re revolutionizing the rehabilitation journey for individuals with Idiopathic Toe Walking (ITW) through advanced technology and data-driven insights. Our device, a compression sock embedded with EMG and IMU sensors, enables continuous monitoring of gait, offering healthcare providers a detailed view of patient progress. By using machine learning to classify ITW severity on a sliding scale, SmartStride delivers tailored, real-time data, helping clinicians make informed adjustments to treatment plans. The smart device truly creates a difference in the lives of patients with this condition..</p>
